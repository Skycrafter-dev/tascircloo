# Circloo native simulator

This directory contains the data-driven Box2D simulator used by the bruteforce
worker. The browser bridge captures a GameMaker physics snapshot immediately
before the editable input window, converts it to the generic runtime model, and
loads that model through the Wasm builder ABI.

The runtime model is not tied to a level number. It supports:

- static, kinematic, and dynamic bodies;
- circle, edge, polygon, and chain fixtures;
- fixture material and collision-filter properties;
- revolute and rope joints, including cached solver state;
- deterministic contact ordering and contact warm-start snapshots;
- player input rules;
- collectible checkpoints;
- delayed boundary replacement and body-spawn patches.

Bruteforce search is WASM-only. If a level model cannot be created or validated,
the worker reports an explicit startup error instead of silently switching to a
slower GameMaker or JavaScript search path.

## Correctness contract

The Level 1 reference fixture is a regression oracle. The native simulator
matches its captured GameMaker state through frame 658 with zero ULP error.

The current best trajectory must match GameMaker before its WASM model is used.
Checkpoint, finish, and point searches then execute entirely in WASM. Point
searches score two-dimensional X/Y distance frame by frame. Highly divergent
mutation probes can depart from the captured model and are treated as fast
heuristics for every target type. Every candidate that could improve the current
best is replayed in the original GameMaker runtime, and only that exact result
can be accepted.

The all-level target-mode matrix verifies `wasm-runtime` on all 20 levels for
checkpoint, finish, and point searches: 60 combinations total.

## Build and test

Build and run the native oracle:

```sh
./native/circloo-sim/build_native.sh
./native/circloo-sim/build/native/level1_reference_test
```

Build the browser Wasm module:

```sh
./native/circloo-sim/build_wasm.sh
```

`build_wasm.sh` expects a WASI sysroot under
`$CIRCLOO_WASI_ROOT`, defaulting to `/tmp/circloo-wasi-toolchain/root`. It copies
the stripped module to `static/game/circloo-sim.wasm`.

With the Vite application open in a Chromium instance exposing CDP on port
9440, the validation tools can be run as follows:

```sh
CDP_PORT=9440 CANDIDATES=512 SCORE_ONLY=1 \
  node native/circloo-sim/tools/randomized_level1_parity.mjs

CDP_PORT=9440 RUNS=3 TRIALS=2000 \
  node native/circloo-sim/tools/test_repeatability.mjs

CDP_PORT=9440 \
  node native/circloo-sim/tools/test_all_level_checkpoints.mjs

CDP_PORT=9440 \
  node native/circloo-sim/tools/test_all_level_target_modes.mjs
```

The benchmark uses the same UI and adaptive worker pool as production:

```sh
CDP_PORT=9440 DURATION_MS=60000 \
  node native/circloo-sim/tools/benchmark_exact_pool.mjs
```
